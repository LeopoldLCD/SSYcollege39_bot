# Telegram Support Bot

This is a Telegram bot designed to provide support to users by allowing them to ask questions and submit ideas. The bot includes functionality for logging user interactions and broadcasting messages from support staff to all users.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Automatically logs users when they interact with the bot.
- **Question Submission**: Users can submit questions that are forwarded to support staff.
- **Idea Submission**: Users can submit ideas or suggestions for improvement.
- **Broadcast Messaging**: Support staff can send messages and images to all users.
- **Log Management**: Maintains logs for users, questions, and ideas, allowing for easy retrieval and management.
- **Support Staff Responses**: Support staff can respond to user inquiries directly through the bot.

## Technologies Used

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) - A simple wrapper for the Telegram Bot API.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pyTelegramBotAPI` library

You can install the required library using pip:

```bash
pip install pyTelegramBotAPI
```

### Configuration

1. **Bot Token**: Obtain a token for your bot from [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) on Telegram.
2. **Support ID**: Get the user ID of the support staff who will manage the bot.
3. **Environment Variables**: It's recommended to use environment variables to store your `TOKEN` and `SUPPORT_ID`. You can set these in your terminal or use a `.env` file.

```bash
export TOKEN='your_bot_token_here'
export SUPPORT_ID='support_user_id_here'
```

4. **Log Files**: The bot will create three log files:
   - `users_log.txt`: Logs user IDs.
   - `questions_log.txt`: Logs submitted questions.
   - `ideas_log.txt`: Logs submitted ideas.

## Usage

1. Start the bot by running the Python script:
   
   ```bash
   python your_bot_file.py
   ```

2. In Telegram, find your bot using its username and start a conversation.

3. Users can interact with the bot using the following commands:
   - `/start`: Begins the interaction and displays options.
   - `/questions_log`: Retrieves the log of submitted questions (accessible to support staff only).
   - `/ideas_log`: Retrieves the log of submitted ideas (accessible to support staff only).
   - `/clear`: Clears duplicate user IDs from logs (accessible to support staff only).

### User Interaction

- Upon starting the bot, users are greeted and can choose from the following options:
  - **‚ùì –ó–∞–¥–∞—Ç—å –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å –°–°–£**: Submit a question.
  - **üí° –ü—Ä–µ–¥–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ/–ó–∞–º–µ—á–∞–Ω–∏–µ**: Submit an idea or suggestion.
  - **üë• –ê–≤—Ç–æ—Ä—ã**: Learn more about the bot's authors.

## Functionality

### Logging Users

The bot automatically logs user IDs in `users_log.txt`. If a user interacts with the bot, their ID is stored unless it already exists in the log.

### Question and Idea Submission

Users can fill out forms to submit questions or ideas. These submissions are logged and forwarded to the support staff.

### Broadcasting Messages

Support staff can broadcast messages and images to all users. This feature is only accessible by the user defined in `SUPPORT_ID`.

### Support Responses

Support staff can reply to user inquiries, which will be sent back to the respective user.

### Log Management

Logs are managed and can be cleared of duplicate user IDs. The bot will inform the support staff when duplicates are removed.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a database for more robust data management.
- Add inline queries for quick responses.
- Improve user interface and experience.
- Add more commands for better user engagement.
